  * Bootstrap
  * JavaScript
  * CSS

* **Other Libraries**:

  * React Router for navigation
  * LocalStorage for persistent data (cart, user authentication)

## How to Use

### Dashboard

The **Dashboard** component is the main page of the application where users can browse products, search, and add them to their shopping cart. Featured products and today's deals are displayed prominently.

### Cart

Users can view their cart, update the quantity of items, and proceed to checkout. The cart is managed using localStorage, so the items persist even if the page is refreshed.

### Search and Categories

The search bar allows users to filter products by categories like Electronics, Fashion, Books, etc.

### User Authentication

The app uses localStorage to check if the user is logged in. If not, they are redirected to the login page.

- Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in the clone URL.
- You can add more details as necessary, especially if you have backend components (e.g., for authentication, cart management).
- This `README.md` assumes that your app is a frontend-only React application. If you have a backend, you can include instructions for that as well.
